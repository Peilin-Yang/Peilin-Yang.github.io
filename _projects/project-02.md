An Android application is developed and was used to collect users data including their movement at indoor and outdoor, the phone movement, de-identified messages and emails, phone calls. All the data is encrypted and stored on secure server. Deep learning algorithm is applied to the data and user depression level is estimated based user's historical data. Possible feedbacks and suggestions on users behavior are sent to the user if the depression risk is detected.

**Achievements:** four phrases of pilot studies were conducted among a wide range of students at University of Delaware. The feedbacks from the users show that the application was very easy to use and the functionality is very useful.
