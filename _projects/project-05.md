Axiomatic approach basically searches for the retrieval functions that satisfy some reasonable retrieval constraints. We can also incorporate it with the semantic term matching method which does the query expansion by choosing the semantically related terms. We tested the effectiveness of combining the two methods and applied it to web search. The results turned out to be promising.
