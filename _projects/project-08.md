Lucene has long history of industrial adoption while it was seldom used by academic community large due to the lack of documentation and code examples. We build Anserini on top of Lucene to enable: (1) Scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, (2) Streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and (3) Extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box.
