Hi, This is Peilin Yang's greetings from the west coast of the United States.

- Currently, I am a software engineer at Twitter Inc. working with data infrastructure platform team. One of the jobs is to design and maintain ETL pipelines such as DAU/MAU and Interaction Counter using [Lambda](/files/pub/SIGMOD2018_Tsar.pdf) and Kappa Architecture. I am also familiar with various backend storages -- Scylla, Vertica, Parquet, Cassandra, etc. Building query services for these backends using Presto/Zeppelin is the fun part.
- Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Delaware (advisor: [Hui Fang](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~hfang/)). My research topics included  **tools for Information Retrieval** ([Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/Anserini), [RISE](https://rise.eecis.udel.edu/), [VIRLab](http://infolab.ece.udel.edu:8008/)), **IR Ranking Model Performance Analysis**, **Contextual Suggestions** and **Mobile AdHoc Networks**. Please see my publications [here](/publications).
- Initially, I was born in Xi'an China, where I had spent more than 20 years to live, go to the college and meet my wife.
