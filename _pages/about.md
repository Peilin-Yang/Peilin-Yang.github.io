Hi, This is Peilin Yang's greetings from the west coast of the United States.

<li style="color:red;"> [New!] I am actively looking for PC member/Reviewer opportunities for IR/ML/Bigdata conferences such as but not limited to SIGIR, CIKM, ECIR, ACL, SIGKDD, SIGMOD, WWW, WSDM, etc.</li>
- Currently, I am a software engineer at Twitter Inc. working for data infrastructure platform team. The interesting part is to leverage Lambda and Kappa Architecture for big data ETL pipelines such as DAU/MAU and Interaction Counter. I also get my hands on various backend stores, e.g. Presto, Scylla, Vertica, Manhattan, Cassandra, and build the query service on top of them.
- Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Delaware (advisor: [Hui Fang](https://eecis.udel.edu/~hfang)) and my research topics include  **tools for Information Retrieval** ([Anserini](https://github.com/castorini/Anserini), [RISE](https://rise.eecis.udel.edu/)), **IR Ranking Model Performance Analysis**, **Contextual Suggestions** and **Mobile AdHoc Network**. Please see my publication at [Publications](/publications).
- Initially, I was born in Xi'an China, where I also has spent more than 20 years to live, went to the college and met my wife.
